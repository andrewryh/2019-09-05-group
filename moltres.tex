	\
		\begin{itemize}
			\item It is an application code built on the \gls{MOOSE}
			framework, for the simulation of \glspl{MSR}.
			\item MOOSE is an open source finite element framework that
			relies on libMesh and PETSc for their advanced meshing and PDE
			solver capabilities.
			\item MOOSE provides a simple interface for creating application
			codes for simulating various physical phenomena.
			\item Moltres contains various "kernels" that each represent the
			various physics present
